# Introduction

## Overview of `xattrs` Project

`xattrs` is a serialization and deserialization framework of ADT (Algebraic Data
Types) classes for Python.

Think of `xattrs` as a tool to convert your ADT classes into a general format
that can be stored, transferred, and shared among applications, threads, network
and more.

## Features

- Support `attrs`, `dataclasses` and `dataclass_transform`
- Batteries included support for common types and protocols
- Highly extensible customization to fit your demands
- Automatic case name transformation (`camelCase`, `snake_case`, `kebab-case`)
- Optional schema validation and conversion
- Flexible configuration with sensible defaults
- Pythonic and typed API design with uncompromising performance
