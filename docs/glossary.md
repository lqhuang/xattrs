## deconstruct

analogy to "construct", "deconstruct" implies taking apart something that has
been built. This term would be apt for a function that breaks down an object’s
state without necessarily deleting the object from memory. However, beware that
"deconstruct" might have specific connotations in some programming contexts or
frameworks.

## SerDe

known as "marshalling" and "unmarshalling" in some contexts. Serialization

## Serialize

in the context of data structures, "serialize" means to convert an object into a
format that can be stored or transmitted. This is often a string or a binary
blob. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that
can be stored or transmitted. This is often a string or a binary blob.

the most common invoked function in Python is `json.dumps()`

## Deserialize

the most common invoked function in Python is `json.load()`

## derive

## instantiate
